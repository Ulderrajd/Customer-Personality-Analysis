# Summary & Recommendations

The model segmented the dataset into 4 groups of customers based on their attributes. Notable groups are group 0 and group 3.

Group 0 has the highest overall income as well as total products purchased, customers from this group also take part in more promotion campaigns. However, group 0 only account a very small portions of the total customers. This urges actions from the company to increase the number of customers in this group.

Group 3 has the second highest overall income as well as total product purchases. This group has the highest number of customers. However, customers in this group seem to neglect the companyâ€™s promotion campaigns as they only accepted one or none of the campaigns. Therefore, company should focus on attracting these customers to the promotion campaigns.
